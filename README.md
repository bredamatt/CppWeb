# CppWeb

This is a way to host your own website via a virtual environment. In this case,
the virtual environment is created using a docker container which is an
abstract representation of an operating system. This operating system
has direct access to resources via its kernel.
Therefore, the web server is running in an abstract environment, with direct
access to resources. Because the server is written in C++, it is highly efficient from a performance perspective.
